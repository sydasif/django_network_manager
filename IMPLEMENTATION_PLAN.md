# Django Network Manager Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the improvements to the Django Network Manager application as detailed in `improvements.md`. The plan follows a phased approach to reorganize the application with a core app as the central hub.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)

- [x] Move NetworkDevice model to core app
  - Created core models (NetworkDevice, DeviceGroup, CommandTemplate)
  - Updated admin interface for new models
  - Created migration files to handle the transition
  - Updated netmiko_tools to reference NetworkDevice from core

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
  - Set up role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
  - Implement device access permissions
  - Add audit logging for all actions

- [ ] Set up API framework
  - Create REST API endpoints for all core functionality
  - Implement API documentation using drf-spectacular
  - Add token-based authentication
  - Implement rate limiting and throttling

- [ ] Enhance device management
  - Add bulk device import/export (CSV, YAML)
  - Implement device credentials encryption
  - Set up device reachability monitoring
  - Add auto-discovery of network devices
  - Implement device configuration backup scheduling

- [ ] Improve command management
  - Add command scheduling
  - Implement command template library
  - Add command output parsing and formatting
  - Implement command result export (CSV, PDF)
  - Add compliance checking

### Phase 3: UI/UX Improvements

- [ ] Design new dashboard
  - Create modern dashboard with device statistics
  - Implement interactive network topology map
  - Add command suggestion system
  - Implement dark/light theme support
  - Add mobile responsiveness

### Phase 4: Security & Performance

- [ ] Implement caching
  - Add caching for frequently accessed data
  - Implement background task processing
  - Enhance security measures
  - Add input validation
  - Implement rate limiting

## Migration Instructions

### Database Migration

To apply the database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This will:
1. Create the new NetworkDevice model in the core app
2. Create the DeviceGroup and CommandTemplate models
3. Migrate data from netmiko_tools.NetworkDevice to core.NetworkDevice
4. Update foreign key references in CommandHistory
5. Remove the old NetworkDevice model from netmiko_tools

### Code Updates

The following code changes have been made:

1. Created core models in `core/models.py`
2. Updated admin interface in `core/admin.py`
3. Updated netmiko_tools to reference NetworkDevice from core
4. Created migration files to handle the transition

## Testing

After applying migrations, test the following:

1. Admin interface for NetworkDevice, DeviceGroup, and CommandTemplate
2. Existing functionality for command execution and history
3. Relationships between devices and device groups

## Future Considerations

- Integration with external systems (IPAM, monitoring, ticketing)
- Automated backups and compliance checking
- Scalability improvements (database optimization, caching)
- Regular maintenance (security updates, database maintenance)
